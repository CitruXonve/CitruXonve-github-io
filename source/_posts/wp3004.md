### Compile manually with mingw

Set environment variables `$CPATH$` and `LIBRARY_PATH` to locate `glut.h` and `glut32.lib`.  
If they are not set, use option `-I'[include_path]'` and `-L'[library_path]'`.  

> g++ [source\_file] -o [target\_file] -lfreeglut -lopengl32 -Wl,--subsystem,windows

### Build with Sublime Text

Create a new build system.  

> {  
> "cmd": ["g++", "${file}", "-o","${file_path}/${file_base_name}","-lfreeglut","-lopengl32","-lglu32","-Wl,--subsystem,windows"],  
"working_dir": "${file_path}",  
> "variants":  
> [  
> {  
> "name": "Run",  
> "cmd": ["cmd","/C","${file_path}/${file_base_name}.exe &pause"]  
> }  
> ]  
> }  


### Build with CMake

[Help about configurations](https://blog.argcv.com/articles/3853.c)  
`CMakeLists`  

> \#\# OpenGL  
> FIND_PACKAGE(OpenGL REQUIRED)  
> INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES(${OPENGL_INCLUDE_DIR})  
> \#\# OpenGL  
> FIND_PACKAGE(GLUT REQUIRED)  
> INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES(${GLUT_INCLUDE_DIR})  
  
> TARGET_LINK_LIBRARIES([project_name] ${OPENGL_LIBRARIES} ${GLUT_LIBRARIES})  

### Error when starting GLUT app when compiled for 64 bit  

> The application was unable to start correctly (0xc000007b).  Click OK to close the application.  

Make sure to link with the correct (64-bit) version of the library, and there is the correct (64-bit) dll available on the path.
