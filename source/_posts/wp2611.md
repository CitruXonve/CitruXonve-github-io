## Remarks on the first "Craft Vessel"
- E3-1231 V3 gets the almost highest efficiency price ratio.  
  The integrated graphic with Intel QSV technology is not necessary. Also, the single core performance of the CPU turns out to be satisfying, even without locking the frequency multiplier at 38x.  
  If an iGPU were to be appended, **E3-1246 v3** are most likely to be accessible. However it is approximate to i7-4770/4790.
- B85 chipset costs a lot less than Z97,yet supports frequency locking and over-clocking.
- Kingston Hyper Fury DDR3 RAMs are not economical compared with others.

## Orientation for the next "Nuclear Craft Vessel"
- B350 motherboards compatible with Ryzen 7 can be a waste.
- A320 motherboards have not been launched yet.
- X99 with DDR4 RAM is quite different from X79 with DDR3.
- E5-2683 v3 has numerous cores and is affordable, but is not so ideal for its single thread performance.
- E5-2637 v3 has strengthful single thread performance, but doesn't have so many cores.
- Double E5-1620 v3 remain to be inspected.
