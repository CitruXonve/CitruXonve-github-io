Rose Frantzen, a relatively young artist, has got a very unususal style as a comtemporary impressionist. However, she lead an arduous life during the days at school. She attended art school, but was told by one of her instructions that she wasn't good at illustration and should go into advertising instead. She had to take both advertising and fine art classes until she was convinced that her work is good enough so that she could be an artist. Another thing is that she had to paint others' portraits at somewhere like art fairs just to make monery to buy paint for her more serious work. No matter how hard it was, she never stopped pursuing of impressionism art. Eventually she is doing extremely well.
Most of us would have been discouraged if we had to face challenges and difficulties like that. The key point is that you keep at it and never give up.
