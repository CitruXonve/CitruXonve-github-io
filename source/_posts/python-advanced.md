- What are the method(s) that iterator object must implement?
> \_\_iter__() and \_\_next__()

- If a function contains at least one yield statement, it becomes **a generator function**.

- In Python, there is a built-in function property() that returns a property object. The property object has which of the following methods?
> getter(), setter() and delete()

- `zip` produces an iterator which can only be iterated once. Once you have iterated it, it's exhausted.

- Where to use closure
    - We must have a nested function (function inside a function).
    - The nested function must refer to a value defined in the enclosing function.
    - The enclosing function must return the nested function.
